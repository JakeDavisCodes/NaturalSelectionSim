Natural Selection Web App
This is a web application that simulates the process of natural selection. The goal of the application is to allow users to observe how traits are passed down from generation to generation and how natural selection can shape the evolution of a population over time.

Features
The Natural Selection Web App includes the following features:

Ability to create and customize populations of organisms
Simulation of natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift
Graphical representation of population statistics over time
Interactive visualization of the evolutionary history of a population
Ability to save and load populations
Installation
To install the Natural Selection Web App, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Start the server by running npm start.
Open the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.
Usage
To use the Natural Selection Web App, follow these steps:

Create a new population by selecting the desired traits and setting the initial population size.
Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin the simulation.
Observe the graphical representation of the population statistics over time.
Click the "View Evolutionary History" button to see the interactive visualization of the evolutionary history of the population.
Use the controls to adjust the simulation settings or save and load populations as desired.
