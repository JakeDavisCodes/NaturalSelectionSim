This is a web application that simulates the process of natural selection. The goal of the application is to allow users to observe how traits are passed down from generation to generation and how natural selection can shape the evolution of a population over time.

# Features
The Natural Selection Web App includes the following features:

Ability to create and customize populations of organisms
Simulation of natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift
Representation of population statistics

# Installation
To install the Natural Selection Web App, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
Start the server by running npm start.
Open the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
To use the Natural Selection Web App, follow these steps:

Create a new population by selecting the desired traits and setting the initial population size or leave blank.
Click the "Step" button to view one step or "Generation" to view a full generation.

Credits
The Natural Selection Web App was created by Jacob Royal Davis. It is based on the principles of natural selection and evolutionary biology.
